The anticipated final outcome of this project is a close inspection of the botnet infection process through modeling and simulation and observation of how variations in the system configuration affect the process. Additionally, we intend to gain insights into the effectiveness of existing security mechanisms and provide recommendations for the feasibility of such measures based on our experimental data and analysis.
